=========================  Criminal Case 3206  =========================

    441344 violated Rule 2143 (Official Reports and Duties) by
    incorrectly stating that there were 7 inactive players (but listing
    8) in eir Registrar's Report of April 9.

History:

Called by omd:                          24 Apr 2012 19:11:28 GMT
Defendant FKA441344 informed:           24 Apr 2012 19:11:28 GMT
Assigned to ais523:                     06 May 2012 18:25:58 GMT
Judged GUILTY/DISCHARGE by ais523:      11 May 2012 22:29:17 GMT

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

Minor mistakes in reports deserve to be pointed out and
punished, in order to hold our officers to account, but minor errors
deserve minor punishments. CFJ 3205 is quite unambiguous that the error
occured (G. is not listed as inactive there, and the activity of each
player is part of the Registrar's report, and G. became inactive on Mar
20 and not active again until Mar 28; and the caller really should have
linked me to the appropriate messages or quoted them to save me spending
five minutes or so looking it up), but there's an interesting legal
point in CFJ 3206. The thing is, the number of inactive players is not
defined as part of the Registrar's report! However, there is some
unfortunate phrasing in rule 2143:

      While performing weekly or monthly duties or publishing weekly
      or monthly reports, officers SHALL NOT publish information that
      is inaccurate or misleading.

Note that this does not require the inaccurate or misleading information
to be part of the report; merely published at the same time. (This is
probably unintended.) Thus, the inaccurate inactive player count is
indeed a violation of rule 2143, but one so minor that I don't feel it
justified to give a nonzero penalty.

Thus, I judge:
CFJ 3206: GUILTY/DISCHARGE
CFJ 3205: GUILTY/APOLOGY {rogue, hack, crawl, tome, jade, powder}

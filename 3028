========================================================================

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

To my knowledge, there were proposals that should have been
distributed that week, omd was responsible for distributing them that
week, and e did not do so.

I judge GUILTY and APOLOGY, with the words being "ice cream",
"irregardless", "სიზმარი", "!Kung", the IUPAC name for titin, the
American Sign language word for "run", "69", "oiwen't", "", and a
circle.

========================================================================

Appellant ais523's Arguments:

I think it's a worrying precedent that an apology /this/ difficult is an
appropriate punishment for what is a relatively minor breach, compared
to some other things that have been given in the past. I also object to
the general trend of apologies having gone down the path of giving
massively difficult words that cannot meaningfully be blended into the
apology in a reasonable way, rather than slightly offbeat ones where
mixing them into the stream of the apology is an interesting task.

========================================================================

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

On CFJ 3028, I judge
GUILTY and APOLOGY, with the words being "ice cream", "irregardless",
"failure", "Hitler", "Godwin's", "law", "lore", "flaw", "floor", and
"potato".

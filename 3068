========================================================================

Appellant scshunt's Arguments:

Judgment is manifestly unjust, etc.

========================================================================

Judge Pavitra's Arguments:

GUILTY. As this is one of several infractions of its general type, I
think a somewhat stronger punishment is appropriate than for a first
offense. APOLOGY/{service, duty, right good forever, pistachio}.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by scshunt:

I apologize sincerely go Agora for the dereliction of my duty and my
failure to resign when it became apparent to me that I wasn't able to
perform the services which I had promised. This is not something that
is good for Agora, nor was it right of me to break my implicit
contract. If officers are not attentive and replaced easily, then
Agora may find itself forever locked in the pistachio incident
(details of which are only available at VIOLET or higher clearance).

==============================  CFJ 3371  ==============================

    The term 'player' is incorrect.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 lindar

Judge:                                  Fool
Judgement:                              FALSE

========================================================================

History:

Called by lindar:                       08 Jul 2013 21:16:55 GMT
Assigned to Fool:                       15 Jul 2013 17:34:41 GMT
Judged FALSE by Fool:                   18 Jul 2013 03:10:04 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

The common vernacular for someone who does something is Xor, where a Xor Xes.
By rule 2408 the 'recordkeepor' is the title for one who keeps records
(or recordkeepes).
By rule 2404,2405,1769, and many more, the 'Promotor' is the title for
one who promotes.
Therefore, the term 'player' is incorrect.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by ais523:

It used to be that "player" and "playor" were obvious synonyms due to
rule 754, and entirely interchangeable. Given that rule 754 seems to
have been repealed, though, I'm not sure if that still applies.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by lindar:

Rule 2337 uses "Player" with a capital P, and 2408 uses "recordkeepor" in all
small case. Let it be know that I suggest we make this consistent in some
fashion, and I would prefer it be in favour of using "Playor", but I do not
now take any action to do anything about it as I am lazy and do no comprehend
the rules.

========================================================================

Judge Fool's Arguments:

FALSE. I reject the callor's arguments, citing rule 1901 (Foolish
Consistency). Common vernaculor has its exceptions, and so can Agoran
doublespeak.

Lindor, I fine you 1 dinnor. I advise you to pay in a timely mannor, because I
am hungry, and, as rule 1902 says, "a dinnor delayed is a dinnor denied" and
we don't want to wind up with anothor case like your friend Tannor (CFJ 3357),
now do we.

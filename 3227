==============================  CFJ 3227  ==============================

    Someone committed the crime of Not Doing Your Own Dirty Work when
    Scapegoat taunted the police.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 Bucky
Barred:                                 Pavitra

Judge:                                  Murphy
Judgement:                              FALSE

========================================================================

History:

Called by Bucky:                        09 Jun 2012 00:03:53 GMT
Assigned to Murphy:                     12 Jun 2012 14:39:07 GMT
Judged FALSE by Murphy:                 12 Jun 2012 14:54:54 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Running with the precedents from CfJ 3209 (and by extension 1890), the "Final
cause" of Scapegoat's action was the cashing of a promise.  In particular, the
creation of that promise was NOT.  Since the language defining the Crime of
Not Doing Your Own Dirty Work (NDYODW) applies it only to actions someone
caused the golem to take by announcement, causing a Slave Golem to violate a
rule by cashing a promise falls outside the scope of NDYODW.  And since
creating the promise was by itself not sufficient to cause the rule violation,
requiring additional first-class person agency to do so, creating the promise
did not violate NDYODW.  Similarly, the actions of transferring the promise
and creating and transferring Scapegoat were not NDYODW, being even further
removed from the action of taunting the police.

Finally, Pavitra (or any other person) did not commit NDYODW because e did not
use Rule 2361 to cause Scapegoat to take any actions.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

I cause BuckyBot to create a Slave Golem named "Scapegoat".
I cause BuckyBot to transfer Scapegoat to me.

I cause Scapegoat to create a Promise, hereafter "Dirty Work", specifying the
text "I taunt the police, specifying 1."
I cause Scapegoat to create a Promise, hereafter "Cleanup", specifying the
text "I deregister."
I cause Scapegoat to transfer the Promise "Dirty Work" to me.
I cause Scapegoat to transfer Cleanup to me.

For good measure, I transfer Scapegoat to Pavitra.

I cash Dirty Work, the promise created above with the text "I taunt the
police, specifying 1.".

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

I accept the caller's arguments.

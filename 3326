Judge woggle's Arguments:

A "body of text" is a part of the proposal. The purported proposal submission
failed to unambiguously identify the body of text even though it unambiguously
identified the intended effect of the proposal.

R217 requires that we be generous when interpreting rules and "communications"
with respect to "synonyms". However, it only deals with how we interpret the
text; to identify the proposal, we may need to consider attributes of the text
besides its interpretation.

Per game custom, we have considered bodies of text the same in spite of minor
formatting differences (and thus we can consider a proposal submission
unambiguous when it's not entirely clear, e.g., how much whitespace is in the
proposal).  But we have not extended this practice to more serious
modifications, and we should be careful about doing so, because it would be
open to abuse by the Promotor. (Even if the Promotor were prohibited from
changing the "effect" or "interpretation" of proposals, E could make other
changes that would be confusing and have a substantial effect on voting.)

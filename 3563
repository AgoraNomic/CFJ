Caller:                       V.J. Rada                    
Barred:                       Publius Scribonius Scholasticus 

Judge:                        Gaelan
                
========================================================================

History:

Called by V.J. Rada:          23 Sep 2017                    
Assigned to:                  

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

I think the most natural reading of "that reason" is the act itself,
not the particular rule breached. That is, someone can be carded twice
for breaking the same pledge on two totally seperate occasions. There
is also a question as to the interpretation of the pledge rule itself.
It says "a pledge is considered broken if...", which may mean that the
pledge is permanently broken, and cannot be broken more than once.

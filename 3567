==============================  CFJ 3567  ==============================

      With the below resolution of intent, VJ Rada won the game by 
      apathy.

========================================================================

Caller:                       V.J. Rada
Barred:                       Publius Scribonius Scholasticus

Judge:                        G.             

========================================================================

History:

Called by V.J. Rada:          27 Sep 2017             

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

First: Is the text, with no spaces between apathy and the next
without, sufficient to create many many intents to win by apathy?

Second: Was Gaelan's attempt sufficient? That consists of finding and
replacing my words with what appears to be "I object" in Chinese.
2a: Is this OK under our language precedents?
2b: Is simply typing "I object" as many times as there are intents,
without more, enough to unambiguously signify which intents the
objector is objecting to?

Third: Is Aris's attempt to object sufficient? E simply stated "I
object to all the intents in the below message" or similar. Under our
precedents, which ban somebody from taking an unreasonable number of
actions in shorthand where copying and pasting would be hard, does
this shorthand take too many actions? Is our precedent in this area,
more common-law than textual, able to be flexibly applied to serve the
purpose of stopping scams as Aris contends?

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Date: Wed, 27 Sep 2017 23:13:28 +1000
From: VJ Rada 
To: agora-business@agoranomic.org
Subject: Re: BUS: Frivolous but harmless scam attempt of the week

I resolve the fifteenth below intent.

Debate away, folks.

==============================  CFJ 3554  ==============================

      When nichdel resolved proposal 7867, he neither published a duty-
      fulfilling report nor resolved an Agoran Decision, for the 
      purposes of the rule "Rewards."

========================================================================

Caller:                       o

Judge:                        ais523
Judgement:                    TRUE

========================================================================

History:

Called by o:                  30 Jul 2017  
Assigned to ais523:           01 Aug 2017
Judged TRUE by ais523:        24 Aug 2017          

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Resolving proposal 7867 occurred before the rule was enacted, and
therefore is not governed by the rules changes in that proposal.

(This is more of a sanity-check CFJ than anything. I don't care
_what_ the outcome is, only that we all agree on which outcome
should apply.)

========================================================================

Judge's Arguments:           

I renumber this CFJ 3554 (it was a duplicate number), and judge it
TRUE. "Meeting a Reward Condition" is something that happens actively,
at a particular point in time. You can't meet a Reward Condition that
doesn't exist, so the condition can only be met if it exists at the
time. This means that you can't claim a reward for something that's now
rewardable, if it wasn't rewardable when it happened, even if it
happened in the last 24 hours.

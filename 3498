==============================  CFJ 3498  ==============================

      Every statement is ambiguous.

========================================================================

Caller:                       天火狐

Judge:                        Gaelan
Judgement:                    FALSE

========================================================================

History:

Called by 天火狐:             19 May 2017
Assigned to Gaelan:           19 May 2017
Judged FALSE by Gaelan:       26 May 2017

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

   * Every statement is written in one language.
   * Translation between any two languages is inherently ambiguous.
   * Therefore, every statement is ambiguous at least in every language
     the statement was not originally written in.
   * Agora does not formally make preference to any one language, and
     recognizes differences in dialect (CFJ 1439).
   * Thus, every statement is ambiguous.

========================================================================

Judge's Arguments

Rule 1698/4:
      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule
      changes to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted
      within a four-week period.

      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to
      exist, it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.  If any other single change to the gamestate
      would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to
      cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

Judging this as TRUE would cause Agora to become ossified (proposals are
created by announcement, announcements must be unambiguous). Therefore,
it is IMPOSSIBLE to judge this CFJ as TRUE. Therefore, I judge as FALSE.

Additional argument: ambiguous is a relative term, but it is clear from
game precedent that in this context it means “reasonably unambiguous to
the players of Agora."

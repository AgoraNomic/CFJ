==============================  CFJ 3010  ==============================

    An entity poorly qualified to judge a case is necessarily not
    unqualified to judge that case.

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

The question is basically as to whether being poorly qualified is a
subset of qualified, one of three options for qualification, or a status
completely indepedent of qualification.

The reason this is relevant is that a judicial panel containing myself
was assigned to case 3004a despite the fact that I was sitting at the
time and thus poorly qualified to judge it. However, poor qualification
does not firectly affect the qualification of the judicial panel
(R2277). I am not sure if such an assignment was legal, since it is not
clear if, due to being poorly qualified, I was not qualified.

By the English interpretation, poorly qualified is still qualified I
think. However, that's unclear at best, and R1871 says
       * Sitting.  Sitting players are poorly qualified to judge, but
         will generally become qualified when the CotC rotates the
         bench.

which implies that poorly qualified entities are not qualified (and by
R1868, qualified is the default for a first-class player such as myself).

Additionally, however, R1871 says
        a) no entity is well-qualified to be assigned to any of them;

This is the only use of "well-qualified", possibly as an antonym of
poorly qualified. This could reinforce the notion that poorly qualified
is a subset of qualified and that well-qualified means "qualified but
not poorly qualified", or well-qualified could just be synonymous with
"qualified".

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

In several previous cases, adding a qualifier to a
term has been found to create a wholly independent term (i.e.
not a subsetted term) if both are explicitly defined by the
ruleset: most recently for "announcement" and "by announcement".

========================================================================

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

[CotC:  referring to CFJ 3009]

For the reasons given above, I judge TRUE.

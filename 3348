==============================  CFJ 3348  ==============================

    This is a CFJ.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 ais523

Judge:                                  Walker
Judgement:                              TRUE

========================================================================

History:

Called by ais523:                       24 Jun 2013 11:29:20 GMT
Assigned to Walker:                     27 Jun 2013 17:22:15 GMT
Judged TRUE by Walker:                  01 Jul 2013 03:07:24 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Clearly, just calling a CFJ by itself works. How many levels
of ISIDTID indirection are needed before announcing that you announce
something stops working?

========================================================================

Judge Walker's Arguments:

I judge both TRUE. As I believe was noted in discussion, "I attempt to
do X" is a commonly accepted longhand for "X". There is an added
implication of "this might fail, but I'm not sure", but this adds
little or no ambiguity to the message: certainly not enough for the
action to fail. In fact, simply writing "X", as players would now have
to do if I had ruled FALSE, would be less helpful to recordkeepers as
they would not get the helpful pointer to double-check the success of
the action, which is clearly not in the interests of the game.

I believe than any (finite) number of "I attempt to do"-s would work,
provided that the meaning of "X", when separated from the rest of the
message, is still clear and unambiguous.

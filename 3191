==============================  CFJ 3191  ==============================

    The Executor of the message quoted in the evidence cannot be
    determined with reasonable effort except by judicial declaration

========================================================================

Caller:                                 Bucky

Judge:                                  FKA441344
Judgement:                              IRRELEVANT

========================================================================

History:

Called by Bucky:                        23 Mar 2012 03:04:19 GMT
Assigned to FKA441344:                  29 Mar 2012 06:25:38 GMT
Judged IRRELEVANT by FKA441344:         09 Apr 2012 22:47:17 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

It appears likely in general that a first-class person who has sent messages
to Agora prior to the first use of the "mister snuggles" nickname  caused this
message to be sent.  I (and several others) have unsuccessfully attempted to
determine which of those persons caused the message to be sent, and those
attempts collectively constitute a reasonable effort.

(As an aside, it is unsafe to assume that all messages sent by "Mister
Snuggles" prior to this were sent by players)

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Message:
{
From: Mister Snuggles <mr.snuglz@gmail.com>
To: agora-business@agoranomic.org
Sent: Tuesday, March 13, 2012 12:27 PM
Subject: BUS: i am an interchangeable part

i am not a player.

i register.

cfj arguments: to agora, all nonplayers are interchangeable.

mister snuggles
}

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

IRRELEVANT, as "Mister Snuggles" has never attempted to
support any intents, and the identity of the Executor does not
otherwise decide anything that could be ratified without an
accompanying declaration (which cannot be included in a judicial
declaration) that the message's sender is a first-class person. :>

========================================================================

Judge FKA441344's Arguments:

I judge case 3191 IRRELEVANT per omd's gratuitous arguments.

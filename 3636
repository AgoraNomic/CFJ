===============================  CFJ 3636  ===============================

      If an Agoran Decision were now initiated, the quorum would be 8.

Caller:                        V.J. Rada

Judge:                         G.
Judgement:                     FALSE

==========================================================================

History:

==========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

The official Assessment recently published listed 9 voters on the most
recent proposal, which would make the quorum 7. However, I contended
that I used PSS to vote FOR that proposal. The language I used was "I
also have PSS vote as I do". The question is whether that language runs
afoul of rule 2466 which institutes a "requirement that the agent
must, in the message in which the action is performed, uniquely
identify the principal and that the action is being taken on behalf of
that person.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge's Arguments:

According to R2466, for A to act on behalf of B to do C, the pieces of
information needed are the identities of A and B, a clear statement of the
action C, and a clear statement of the relationship of A and B (i.e. that
A is acting on behalf of B). Any reasonably clear grammatical construction
that specifies all these elements should work.

In context, "I also have PSS vote as I do" (where the votes in question
were also in the message) does the trick.  I was concerned initially that
"I have PSS" doesn't get enough of the sense of acting-on-behalf.  This
might be true if the acting permission came from an obscure contract that
no one remembered very well.  But in recent game context, the
zombie-master relationship is sufficiently clear.

The voters on the proposal that determined quorum at the time of the CFJ
(Proposal 8041) were thus:
       Aris, Corona, Trigon, V.J. Rada, Quazie, ATMunn, Kenyon, G., PSS
With 9 voters, quorum was 7.  I judge FALSE.

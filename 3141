==============================  CFJ 3141  ==============================

    If, during a Holiday, the CotC assigns a judge to a judicial case
    other than emself, that judge has violated rule 1769.

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

The relevant part of rule 1769 seems to apply the SHALL NOT
to the judge, not to the player who does the assignment. This is
probably buggy, and a little weird, but is the best testcase of this
I've seen (rather better than attempting to submit players as evidence
on a judicial case, or as proposals with the wrong II, or whatever).

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

this excerpt from rule 1769: "judges SHALL NOT be assigned to
any judicial case"

========================================================================

Judge FKA441344's Arguments:

The rule does apply the "SHALL NOT" to the judge who "[is] assigned to
any judicial case". I judge case 3140 FALSE and case 3141 TRUE.

========================================================================

Request for reconsideration by <function player at 0xb6d4d844>:

The literal reading behind these
judgements blames the judge for something out of eir control; the
less literal reading ("the assigner of judges SHALL NOT assign judges")
avoids that problem, and is reasonably obvious to infer.

========================================================================

Judge FKA441344's Arguments:

The new arguments do not seem to be relevant. There is no rule that
prevents rules from making acts that the actor cannot control illegal,
and rule 1504(e) suggests that this can happen and nullifies the
problem of people being punished for acts they could not have avoided.
I once again judge case 3140 FALSE and case 3141 TRUE.

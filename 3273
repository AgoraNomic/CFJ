Caller:                                 Murphy
Barred:                                 scshunt

Judgement:                              TRUE

History:

Called by Murphy:                       27 Sep 2012 00:16:44 GMT
Assigned to omd:                        27 Sep 2012 01:28:54 GMT
Judged TRUE by omd:                     27 Sep 2012 02:57:41 GMT

Caller's Arguments:

When the decision became Democratic, voting limits ceased
to be determined by Rule 2375 and came to be determined by Rule 683.

========================================================================

Judge omd's Arguments:

Plutocratic is clearly a condition for performing an action
(increasing an entity's voting limit on a decision) - though such an
action has been interpreted in the past as a redefinition of voting
limit for the affected decisions, since voting limit is not a switch,
there is no reason the definition would stop applying when the
conditions under which the action could be taken anew cease to be
true.  The context is not enough.

========================================================================

Judge omd's Evidence:

Rule 2375/0 (Power=2)
Plutocratic Chamber

      Plutocratic is a Voting Chamber. The default voting limit of an
      entity on a Plutocratic Decision is zero. Any entity may spend a
      Ruble to increase an entity's voting limit on a Plutocratic
      Decision by 1.

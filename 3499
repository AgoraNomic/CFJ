==============================  CFJ 3499  ==============================

      Agora need not be played in English.

Caller:                       Publius Scribonius Scholasticus

Judge:                        nichdel
Judgement:                    DISMISS

========================================================================

History:

Called by Publius Scribonius Scholasticus:   19 May 2017
Assigned to nichdel:                         19 May 2017
Judged DISMISS by nichdel:                   19 May 2017

========================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

I judge 3499 and 3500 DISMISS.

The rules of Agora, as written, require no specific language to be used.
In fact, the language of R869/3 seems to go out of its way to avoid
mentioning any languages [1]. When words and phrases are defined by the
rules they become part of the embedded language of the game, and cannot
be said to be 'English' any more than the keywords and syntax of a
programming language can be.

Rules that refer to ambiguity and resolvability are asking for player
agreement that something occured a specific way, not that the thing
itself be objective truth. The entire existence of the CFJ system is
evidence of this. Given this, if a majority of players decide something
is 'unknowable', for any reason including eir own inability to speak a
language, then for game purposes it is. Conversely, if players agree
that a thing is knowable or a message intelligible, even if it is not
knowable or intelligible to anyone outside the community, it is for game
purposes.

There also exists a considerable body of practical evidence that Agora
is not played only or strictly in English:

-Text in R2029/4 defies any recognizable version of English's grammar
 [2].
-CFJ 915 explicitly rejects any attempt to require "any particular
 language, method, or format for communications". It also acknowledges
 that not every player need comprehend a message for it to be successful
 [3].
-CFJ 1460 rejects a message in Turkish, not because it is not English
 but because it is not intelligible to any players [4].
-CFJ 1439 finds that there is no language requirement, and at least one
 decidedly non-English message has succeeded in the past [5].
-The existence of at least one Organization whose charter is not in
 English has been repeatedly ratified and upheld.

Agora, the game, does not require or prohibit any language. Agora, the
community, is limited to only the messages it can collectively
comprehend.

communicating independent thoughts and ideas is a person."

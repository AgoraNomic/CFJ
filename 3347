==============================  CFJ 3347  ==============================

    If a player is required to make an officer's report, but also holds
    the    Office of Governmental Waste, resigning the office of
    Governmental Waste    is a reasonable way (as per R1504d) to avoid
    breaking Rule 2395.

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

First, this case is wholly IRRELEVANT if the previous case is FALSE.

It's been found previously, *in general*, that if an Officer is found
in a nest of conflicting duties, that it's not reasonable (in an R1504d
sense) to ask em to resign to avoid the breaches, as it is better for
the game that officers not be forced to resign.

However, in this case, a person holding the Governmental Waste office
while holding another non-wasteful office is violating the entire
raison d'Ãªtre of Governmental Waste in the first place, so it's only
reasonable that the solution be to resign.

========================================================================

Judge lindar's Arguments:

It is the opinion of this judge that indeed resigning is a reasonable
way to avoid breaking the aforementioned rule. While it is not
necessarily in the best interest of Agora as a whole to situationally
force officors to resign, it is a viable strategy. However, we should
set an example such that players who hold multiple offices do not
attempt to manipulate penalty leniency to unfairly gain for
themselves. The judge also agrees that holding a position in another
office as well as the OoGW violates the spirit of said office, but
this wasn't really the point of the judgement or necessarily the
question asked.

For what it's worth, even though it doesn't really do much, the ruling is:
TRUE

Judge Walker's Arguments:

FALSE: there are clearly millions of singles.

========================================================================

Request for reconsideration by <function player at 0xb6d4d56c>:

I intend, with two support, to file motions to reconsider these cases
as, per R2347
       The Speed switch is a single switch, tracked by the Assessor,
       with values of Slow, Normal (default) and Fast. The Speed switch
       is secured.

This meens that The Speed is a switch possessed by every single, which
Walker just judged to be at least millions of them. Therefore there can
hardly be just one Speed switch.

========================================================================

Request for reconsideration by <function player at 0xb6d4d56c>:

Indeed, it's unclear that the rule defines a switch successfully and the
judge missed/did not discuss the connection.  I support the motion to
reconsider.  -G.

========================================================================

Judge Walker's Arguments:

After considering the arguments made in discussion I concur that the
rule fails to define the switch. I honestly did not consider that
R2347 might be interpreted as defining a switch applying to all
'singles', as opposed to being a switch of which there is only one
instance. I think that the interpretation that the Rule attempts to
define this but fails due to R2162 a) is reasonable.

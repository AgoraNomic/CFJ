==============================  CFJ 3200  ==============================

    The Executor of actions performed by announcement in a cashed
    promise is generally the same as the Executor of the message in
    which the promise was cashed.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 Bucky

Judge:                                  scshunt
Judgement:                              FALSE

========================================================================

History:

Called by Bucky:                        09 Apr 2012 04:16:12 GMT
Assigned to scshunt:                    09 Apr 2012 04:49:16 GMT
Judged FALSE by scshunt:                09 Apr 2012 22:29:40 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Cashing a promise causes its text to be effectively published by its author;
it doesn't actually cause them to send a message.  The person who most
directly caused the message to be sent is the person who cashed the promise.
Therefore, they are the Executor of any actions performed in that message,
regardless of who performed them.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

The Executor of a public message is the first-class person who sends it, or
who most directly and immediately causes it to be sent.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

The definition of "publish" and "announce" (as in "executor of
the announcement") involves sending a message; it seems clear that
cashing a promise creates a simulated message.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Pavitra:

You're being silly; the CFJ is obviously TRUE. The whole point of
executorhood is to cut through all the layers of simualation and
indirection and get to the actual person who pushes the button.

========================================================================

Judge scshunt's Arguments:

The only sensible interpretation of the 'or' in Rule 2170 is that it
presents a fallback provision, so the 'most directy' test is used only
where the message is sent by a first-class player. But Rule 2338 says
that the text inside a promise is interpreted as if published; the
judge concurs with H. omd's arguments that it should be interpreted as
creating a simulated message.

As such, this CFJ is FALSE.

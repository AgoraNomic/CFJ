========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

Neither the small text nor the big text obviously
takes precedence over the other, so FALSE by ambiguity.

========================================================================

Judge FKA441344's Arguments:

I accept Murphy's gratuitous arguments and judge this FALSE.

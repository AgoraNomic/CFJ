==============================  CFJ 3121  ==============================

    Agora is stuck in an infinite loop.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 scshunt

Judge:                                  Murphy
Judgement:                              FALSE

========================================================================

History:

Called by scshunt:                      06 Nov 2011 21:19:40 GMT
Assigned to Murphy:                     10 Nov 2011 16:35:13 GMT
Judged FALSE by Murphy:                 10 Nov 2011 16:58:39 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

I create a Promise with the following text, and then cash it: {{I cash
this Promise. This Promise is not destroyed by being cashed.}}

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by ais523:

I'm moderately sure that Agora is at least
multithreaded, and that the loop can easily be stopped without objection
by Horton.

Also, I'm not sure if this is an actual paradox, given that it doesn't
have any game effects. (When I did something similarly with the Gnarlier
Contract, the paradox "escaped" to the gamestate via pledginess; I don't
think something similar is possible here.)

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Pavitra:

The most reasonable interpretation seems to me that scshunt
cashed the promise an infinite number of times simultaneously, and did
not cash it during any subsequent instant.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Machiavelli:

generally, sequences of actions are considered to take
place in a single instant, as long as they don't contain any explicit
time delays. Therefore, following game custom, it seems most likely
that the loop, despite being infinite, took place entirely within a
single instant and is no longer taking place.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

See CFJ 2737.  This attempt depends on a similar induction chain, and
Rule 2338 doesn't explicitly state that actions-by-cashing-a-promise
can form an infinite chain.

Apart from that, I accept the gratuitous arguments, and also note that
the loop would not create any recordkeeping burdens (contrast the
hypothetical gamestate in which Horton was required to select a random
number associated with each cashing action).

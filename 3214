Caller's Arguments:

Ack, how broken *was* my proposal?

========================================================================

Judge scshunt's Arguments:

Nothing in the rules implies that they would.

========================================================================

Request for reconsideration by <function player at 0xb6d4d5dc>:

I intend to motion to reconsider with two support.  The rules are
silent on what exactly the proposal pool *is*, and it is reasonable and
within common definitions to assume it is simply the pool (group, set,
collection) of proposals that have been created but not explicitly
removed from said set.

If this is not so, the reason it is not so deserves more treatment.

========================================================================

Judge scshunt's Arguments:

As far as I can tell from Zefram's archives, the Proposal Pool was
introduced by proposal 4072, authored by Steve. The FLR at the time
can be seen at http://agora.qoid.us/oldflr/1.1#rule-1770. In
particular, this gives no definition of the Proposal Pool, so
"Definition & Continuity of Entities" does not seem to apply since the
Proposal Pool was never defined.

However, proposal 7216 was the first time that there was no specific
mechanism to add Proposals to the Proposal Pool (although ratification
did continue to function, which is why Agora remained a Nomic). The
reason for this is not going to be a subject of speculation by this
Court. As such, the removal of this reference, in the Court's opinion,
did indeed remove the ability to add proposals to the Proposal Pool by
creating them.

Hence, FALSE.

=========================  Criminal Case 3075  =========================

    Yally violated Rule 2157 (Judicial Panels) by failing to act to
    ensure that the judicial panel of scshunt, Yally and Pavitra
    satisfied its obligations with regards to CFJs 3028a and 3029a.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by scshunt:

Did the panel fail to satisfy its obligations? If not, surely this is
NOT GUILTY.

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

The obligation is on the individual members ("each member of
the panel SHALL"), and thus Yally violated rule 2341, not 2157.

Aha, I missed that. I support Murphy's motion to reconsider.

Just because Yally violated R2341 doesn't mean that e didn't also
violate R2157 via the same inaction.

Consider these hypothetical situations where the panel of Alice, Bob
and Charlie is assigned to an appeal:

  1) None of the panelists publish an opinion or otherwise cause the
     panel to judge on time.  Each of them violates both R2341 and
     R2157.

  2) Only Alice publishes an opinion, not enough to trigger "the panel
     acts" in R2341, and none of them otherwise cause the panel to
     judge on time.  Bob and Charlie violate both R2341 and R2157;
     Alice probably gets NOT GUILTY on R2157 due to R1504(e), especially
     if she reminded the others before the time limit expired.

  3) Alice and Bob publish matching opinions, Charlie doesn't publish
     an opinion, and "the panel acts" in R2341 is triggered when the
     time limit is reached.  (This is the situation at hand.)  Charlie
     violates R2341, and may also violate R2157 because - even though
     the panel acted - e didn't perform any action contributing to
     causing it to do so.  (On the other hand, once Alice and Bob's
     opinions were published, maybe R2157 no longer required Charlie
     to perform any action because the panel was already set to act.)

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

The other panelists (and, in fact, most appeals panels in recent memory) have
violated the rule in question, and given the existence of separate panel
opinions, it isn't really a sensible thing to punish for, and doesn't
hurt the game if violated.

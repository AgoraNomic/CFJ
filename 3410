Exhibit by scshunt:

Evidence:
>From the report in question:
>
> Year of Deregistration                                Reg.        Dereg.
> 1994 to 2012: http://zenith.homelinux.net/agora_deregistrations.txt
>From R478:
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent
      to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
      be public.  A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. A
      person "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public
      message.
>From R2143:
      a) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         week.  If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's weekly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir weekly duties.
>From R2139:
      The Registrar's report includes:
      ...
      c) For each former player for which the information is
         reasonably available, the dates on which e registered and
         deregistered.
Arguments:
The report does not include a published copy of this information, but
a hyperlink. I think that the requirement of publication means that
the information must be sent via the fora, and that a link (while
recommended by R2143) is insufficient to constitute publication and
fulfill the requirements of a report.

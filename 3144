==============================  CFJ 3144  ==============================

    Rule 2351 indirectly allows players to make arbitrary modifications
    to the game state.

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 2339 allows players to cause Agora Nomic to perform an action with Agoran
Consent or without objection. Rule 2351 allows Agora to make arbitrary changes
to the game state. Therefore, by instructing Agora to make a given
modification to the game state, a player can modify the game state
arbitrarily.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by FKA441344:

This is FALSE
due to Rule 105 and case 1499 and the fact that Agora does not
currently have a power.

========================================================================

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

Well, I can see two possible interpretations of this statement. One is
"Rule 2351 indirectly allows each individual player to make arbitrary
modifications to the game state", which I think is false. The other is
"Rule 2351 indirectly allows players in tandem to make arbitrary
modifications to the game state", which is more interesting. I will
interpret the statement in the latter way.

Rule 2339 says that Agora Nomic is intended to be a person, and if it
is a person, players can cause it to take arbitrary actions. Is it, in
fact, a person? Rule 2328 states that it is, as long as it is an
agreement between two or more players. I don't believe that all
players of Agora necessarily agree to Agora, but I think we can assume
that at least two of them do. So, Rule 2339 does say that players CAN
cause Agora to act.

Rule 2351 then says that Agora can make arbitrary changes to the game
state. However, Agora is not an instrument, and Rule 2140 implies that
Agora cannot modify instruments. Rule 2140 takes precedence in this
case, so Agora cannot actually make arbitrary changes to the game
state; its changes are limited to those that do not modify
instruments.

Therefore, I judge FALSE.

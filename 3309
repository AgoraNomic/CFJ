==============================  CFJ 3309  ==============================

    Proposal 7386 failed to fully take effect because it attempted to
    modify a substantial aspect of Proposal 7411

========================================================================

History:

Called by Bucky:                        21 Apr 2013 17:20:34 GMT
Assigned to woggle:                     27 Apr 2013 19:43:33 GMT
Judged FALSE by woggle:                 04 May 2013 02:12:58 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Proposal 7386 attempted to repeal the rule defining the author of Proposal
7411.  This would cause Proposal 7411 to not have an author.  Changing the
author would violate Rule 2350.

========================================================================

Judge woggle's Arguments:

Proposal 7386 does not destroy all Golems, and therefore did not itself
attempt to modify a substantial aspect of Proposal 7411.

Instead, if this modification was attempted at all, it was attempted by R1586,
which requires that when a Rule-defined entity is repealed, that that entity
cease to exist. This is sufficient to judge this CFJ FALSE.

With respect to whether R1586 interferes with the prohibition on modifications
to proposals as applied to undefining a proposal's author:

The author of a proposal is defined -- not just initially set -- by
referencing the event of the creation of the proposal. Thus, the prohibition
on modification of the author attribute prevents creating a legal fiction that
a different entity created the proposal. Although we do not normally allow
game entities to continue to refer to destroyed entities, it is appropriate to
do so when the defining rule explicitly examines history.

Another issue is whether properties of the author besides whether it created
the proposal deserve protection as an "attribute" of a proposal. The authors
existence and attributes are only incidental to the typical operation of the
proposal, so I hold that it does not. This is unlike other attributes of the
proposal which typically function principally as part of the proposal, like
the proposal's text or the proposal's AI.

==============================  CFJ 3014  ==============================

    If the promise quoted in evidence with the alleged condition "This
    promise is not destroyed upon being cashed" was cashed, then it
    would not be destroyed.

Caller's Arguments:

There are unambiguous ways to accomplish the intent (e.g.
the condition "1 = 1" or any other tautology), but it seems too far a
stretch to interpret this as equivalent to such a construction (which
tautology should be chosen)?  The clause could be interpreted
literally, in which case it has the same ambiguity of truth value as
"This statement is true"; but the intent is obvious, so the ambiguity
should be resolved in line with it.

Judge ais523's Arguments:

I read the statement as a pretty clear "This statement is
true" analogue. However, the situation is a bit more interesting than
that. A promise cannot be cashed unless all its conditions are true.
Thus, if the condition in question is false, it is vacuously true (as
the condition cannot be cashed at all), leading to a contradiction; but
if it's true, there's no contradiction. In such a case, being true is
the most sensible truth value for the statement. The statement of 3014
has a very clear conditional, which works much the same way but is even
less ambiguous; if the promise can be cashed at all, it isn't destroyed.
Thus, definitely TRUE. (As a side effect, it turns out that the
condition in question doesn't restrict the promise in question from
being cashed after all.)

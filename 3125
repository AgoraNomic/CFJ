=========================  Criminal Case 3125  =========================

    scshunt broke rule 2338 by cashing a promise with insufficient
    context.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by scshunt:

First, I dispute the notion that there is insufficient referent. The
message is generated via a promise. If 'this promise' has sufficient
referent within the first attempt to cash it, then there is no reason
to believe that that referent would change with multiple recursive
applications of the promise. Moreover, the analogy to rules and
proposals is flawed, as would the following proposal not succeed?

{{
Enact a new power-4 rule entitled "Superpowers" reading
      This proposal CAN make arbitrary changes to the gamestate, rules
to the contrary notwithstanding.

Simultaneously enact two new rules, reading 'Tweedledee' and
'Tweedledum', respectively.

Repeal 'Superpowers'.
}}

While the referent to 'this proposal' has no meaning outside the
context of the application of the proposal, it certainly does for the
duration of the proposal. Applying the common-sense interpretation per
R217, this would succeed. Likewise, I argue that the body of the
promise, by referring to 'this promise', provides itself with
sufficient context to apply correctly.

========================================================================

Judge omd's Arguments:

"This promise" and similar constructions, while awkward considering
how promises work, are well precedented:

(omd) "I publicly congratulate the casher for eir judgement."
(G.) "I transfer 6 points to the casher of this promise."
(scshunt) "I retract any votes on the Proposal N and vote to ENDORSE
the player cashing this promise."
(scshunt) "I transfer 5 points to the cashier."

Since there is an obvious and unambiguous referent, I see no reason to
forbid the term.  NOT GUILTY.

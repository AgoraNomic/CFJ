Caller's Arguments:

Arguments: I'm not sure exactly what "[no] player of [Agora] can make
arbitrary changes to the gamestate" means, but it sounds suspiciously
like an Agora Is a Nomic violation.

(Note that AIaN was amended by my proposal in the immediately prior
resolution.)

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by ais523:

"no player of Agora can make arbitrary changes to the
gamestate" translates as "for each player of Agora, there is at least
one gamestate change they cannot make". I don't think that's an AIAN
violation, unless it happens to be the same change for each player. (All
this seems to do is platonically claim that dictatorship scams don't
exist, which probably needs fixing...)

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

It was presumably already the case that no player could make an
arbitrary change to the gamestate (barring a currently unknown
dictatorship scam), so this doesn't change anything. Note that "no
player can make arbitrary changes to the gamestate" does not imply "no
combination of players can make arbitrary changes to the gamestate",
which is what AIAN blocks.

Note that it doesn't even block AIAN to forbid some sorts of changes
entirely, so long as it's still possible to repeal the rule that forbids
it (which would provide a mechanism to make the change anyway).

Judgement:                    

========================================================================

History:

Called by o:                  7 Sep 2017                    
Assigned to:                  

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 2498 (“Economic Wins”) states, in part:

> Players MAY, by announcement, destroy a Stamp and cause Agora to
> transfer the Stamp Value, in shinies, to em.

Under rule 2125 (“Regulated Actions”), destroying Stamps is restricted:

> An action is restricted if:
> ...

> which some player is required to be a recordkeepor.

The recordkeepor of Stamps is, under rule 2498 (“Stamps”), the Secretary.

Therefore, it is not possible to destroy stamps through any mechanism
described in rule 2498. Rule 2166 (“Assets”) does provide a mechanism
for destroying stamps:

> An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
> subject to modification by its backing document.

This power is not restricted by the backing document for stamps, but
Gaelen did not own any stamps at that time.

Therefore, no stamps were destroyed by Gaelan’s actions.

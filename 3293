Caller's Arguments:

The Lost and Found Department is a Marine (an asset) and owned by itself.

========================================================================

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

As Rule 2386 "Belligerence" has been repealed, the mechanism by which
Marines purportedly could be destroyed no longer exists; therefore, I
judge IRRELEVANT.

If Rule 2386 had not been repealed, I believe this would be false; per
CFJ 3290, Rule 2386 failed to define marines as units.

========================================================================

Request for reconsideration by <function player at 0xb6d4d6f4>:

The phrasing of the IRRELEVANT clause is in a subordinate clause to the
overreaching statement of timing in R591, so it is far more reasonable
to go with the actual wording than a minor grammatical inconsistency.

========================================================================

Request for reconsideration by <function player at 0xb6d4d6f4>:

As I see it, there is no inconsistency here. Truth values are
evaluated at the time the inquiry case was initiated, and everything
else is evaluated at the time the inquiry case is judged; that is what
the rules say, and nothing in the rules contradicts this. In my
opinion, common sense also agrees with this interpretation: the
relevance of the statement at the time the case was initiated is less
important than the relevance of the statement at the time the case is
judged.

========================================================================

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

per CFJ 3290, Rule 2386 failed to define marines as units. Therefore,
the Lost and Found Department, despite being a Marine, was not a unit,
and thus was not an asset, and thus was not owned by the Lost and
Found Department.

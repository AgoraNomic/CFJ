but I don't think the (implicitly defined)
ratified document actually includes the text of the proposal that took
effect, even if the physical message in question did.

Gratuitous Arguments by Machiavelli:

Rule 2034 states, "A public document purporting
to resolve an Agoran decision constitutes self-ratifying claims that
[stuff happened]". The most straightforward meaning of "to constitute"
is "to be all of the parts of", but clearly this is not the intended
meaning; the intended meaning seems to be more along the lines of "to
give rise to, and determine the nature of". So when the Assessor's
document gave rise to a claim that Proposal 7330 took effect, was the
claim simply the statement "Proposal 7330 took effect", or did the
claim also include the proposal's text, as the Assessor's document
did?

I guess the former seems to make more sense, ignoring the best
interests of the game.

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

Excerpt from rule 2034/6:
"A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision constitutes
self-ratifying claims that"

Rule 1551/15, paragraph 1:
"A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message."

The issue at issue in this case is what the relevant public document is,
in the case of a proposal resolution. Based on the plain definitions in
the rules, the only conclusion I can think of is that every part of a
public message that purports to resolve an Agoran decision is
self-ratifying. Due to the "(possibly all)", it seems reasonable that
"part" has a meaning similar to "consecutive sequence of characters that
makes sense on its own and obeys natural boundaries of the message",
rather than a meaning similar to "chapter".

As such, we can deduce that multiple documents self-ratified; the
portion of the message that did not include the text/title/power of the
rule (because it did not include the text of the proposal) did nothing
upon self-ratification, but the entire message (which is also a
document) repealed the rule upon self-ratification.

This implies that the rules are not broken in the way that was
anticipated when this case was called. I judge CFJ 3297 TRUE.

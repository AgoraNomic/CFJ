==============================  CFJ 3302  ==============================

    scshunt CAN, by announcement, cause a proposal to take effect.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 Wes

Judge:                                  Murphy
Judgement:                              FALSE

========================================================================

History:

Called by Wes:                          10 Apr 2013 18:16:46 GMT
Assigned to Murphy:                     14 Apr 2013 07:36:21 GMT
Judged FALSE by Murphy:                 14 Apr 2013 07:40:53 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

We believe this statement to be false, as it conflicts with Rule 106,
which states:

      If there is no Agoran Decision to adopt a particular proposal
      that has an outcome of ADOPTED, that proposal CANNOT take
      effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

This would appear to be a clear conflict, and as Rule 106 has greater
Power, this would appear to render that element of Rule 2380
ineffective.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Machiavelli:

for Agoran Decisions that do not have an outcome of
ADOPTED, I think the answer is uncontroversially FALSE. For Agoran
Decisions that do have an outcome of ADOPTED (and, in particular, ones
with a Power greater than 1), the question is more interesting.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

That clause was intended to allow scshunt to cause a high-AI proposal that had
previously been adopted (so high-Power) to take effect again.  It was ruled in
CFJ 3277 that this constitutes a substantive change to the proposal and so
fails.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

scshunt can do this for some proposals (AI = 1 and
outcome = ADOPTED) but not others.

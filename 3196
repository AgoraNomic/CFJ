Caller's Arguments:

ehird is deregistered, thus not a voter.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

scshunt wrote:

>>> 7196 3   scshunt     Truisms
>> ENDORSE ehird

Rule 2127 (Conditional Votes), relevant excerpt:

      Casting a vote endorsing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is the same as the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.

========================================================================

Judge omd's Arguments:

CFJ 2449's interpretation was that "voter" actually means "person who
has voted", not "eligible voter", but the identity of the voter is
part of the condition (and evaluated at the end of the voting period)
- in this case, a conditional vote for a non-voter would be valid but
evaluate to PRESENT.  I'm a little skeptical of this interpretation,
but even if "casting a vote endorsing another voter" is treated more
straightforwardly as a requirement that the vote endorse a particular
eligible voter, we are still left with scshunt's message, which did
not satisfy a particular Rules definition but was still clearly and
unambiguously an attempt to perform a specific action - conditionally
casting a vote whose value is the same as the most common value (if
any) among ehird's valid votes on that decision - again, PRESENT.

==============================  CFJ 3186  ==============================

    To initiate a criminal case, Rule 1504 requires specifying exactly
    one action the Accused allegedly performed or failed to perform.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 Murphy
Barred:                                 FKA441344

Judge:                                  omd
Judgement:                              TRUE

========================================================================

History:

Called by Murphy:                       26 Feb 2012 16:31:22 GMT
Assigned to omd:                        10 Mar 2012 18:20:15 GMT
Judged TRUE by omd:                     11 Mar 2012 08:34:14 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1504 requires specifying "a <whatever>" in order to initiate, and
the rest of it generally appears to assume that this means "exactly one
<whatever>".  The alternate interpretation "at least one <whatever>"
may be possible to use, but would at least have interesting consequences
likely to lead to further adjudication and/or legislation (e.g. if you
accuse X and Y of Z, and X did it but Y didn't, then GUILTY unfairly
dings Y while NOT GUILTY may unfairly give X a double-jeopardy defense).

Inquiry cases specifying multiple statements have been allowed, but
only because that rule is written differently.  Currently, Rule 591
merely requires the announcement to "include" a statement, with a
judgement of MALFORMED if the initiator failed to specify a single
statement (e.g. CFJ 2924).  The first multiple-statement CFJ that I
remember is CFJ 1266, which was dismissed due to a different but
similar rule.

Obligatory digging: CFJ 6 most likely counts
(http://zenith.homelinux.net/cotc/stare_detail/06.txt).

========================================================================

Judge omd's Arguments:

This is about a criminal case in which I am the defendant, so I would
recuse myself, but I think this is pretty clear cut: indeed, the rest
of the rule uses "the Accused", "the specified rule", "the specified
act", and it is common practice to use "a" to mean "one" - "specifying
an integer from 1 to 14", "the enacting instrument may specify a title
for the new rule".  TRUE on 3184-86.  (But it may be the case that
"did X and Y" can be considered a single, composite "action".)

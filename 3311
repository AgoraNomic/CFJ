=========================  Criminal Case 3311  =========================

    Murphy violated Rule 2143 by failing to publish a VVLOP report in
    the previous week.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 scshunt
Barred:                                 Murphy

Judge:                                  G.
Judgement:                              GUILTY/COMMUNITY SERVICE

========================================================================

History:

Called by scshunt:                      27 Apr 2013 22:33:18 GMT
Defendant Murphy informed:              27 Apr 2013 22:33:18 GMT
Assigned to G.:                         28 Apr 2013 16:21:52 GMT
Judged GUILTY/COMMUNITY SERVICE by G.:  14 May 2013 22:43:41 GMT

========================================================================

Judge G.'s Arguments:

Verdict:   GUILTY.  As the requirement had been in effect since 27-March,
           there was sufficient time for the Officer to inform emself of
           the clear duty.

Sentence:  This is a standard application of the Class-2 Crime of Tardiness
as explicitly defined by the rules.  Recent cases on report production have
been varied on whether there is a fixed schedule, or whether leniency should
depend on the importance of the report.  If the latter, I would admit that
I was mildly annoyed at the missing report for a few days, therefore showing
it to be an important report, therefore I would through the full weight of
the law around here.

I prefer a set standard.  The question is, what is a Class-2 Crime, exactly
worth these days? There is absolutely no definition or point of comparison
in the current ruleset.  The only guidance is that Exile is considered the
worst crime, and the worst crime that should be defined in the rules is
Class 14.  Therefore, exile is class-14, and a Class-2 crime is 1/7 as bad
as Exile.

This is actually quite reasonable here, as Exile is mapped to 2 months, and
the crime of tardiness is (generally) on the scope of a week of missing
a duty, so that's in the right order of magnitude.  Accordingly, the
defendant should be place Under a Cloud for around a week.

But TIME OUT, as described, is both too harsh and too lenient.  It has
the effect of removing the player from Postulated Offices (too hard a
punishment) while not actually preventing em from performing many
voluntary tasks of gameplay.  It is better to ask the Ninny to keep eir
duties, but limit eir ability to play the game.

Therefore, I sentence that, as an act of COMMUNITY SERVICE, for the next
7 days, the Ninny SHALL NOT spend any Rules-defined Currency, nor transfer
any asset from emself, nor cash or create any Promise, unless otherwise
explicitly REQUIRED to by the rules.

==============================  CFJ 3031  ==============================

    Droowl is a player.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 Pavitra

Judge:                                  Murphy
Judgement:                              TRUE

========================================================================

History:

Called by Pavitra:                      05 Jun 2011 02:48:02 GMT
Assigned to Murphy:                     16 Jun 2011 01:37:56 GMT
Judged TRUE by Murphy:                  18 Jun 2011 03:37:42 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

By R869 (How to Join and Leave Agora), citizenship is an entity switch;
in particular, Droowl's citizenship has a citizenship switch.

R2162 (Switches) reads in part as follows:
                      "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
        exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
        X.

Thus, when Droowl attempted to register (that is, to cause eir
citizenship switch to become Registered), e thereby attempted to
register eir citizenship switch along with emself.

However, R869 says:
       A non-person CANNOT be registered (or created in a Registered
       state), rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

Thus, Droowl's attempt to register eir citizenship switch platonically
failed. Since the above-quoted section of R2162 ties "becoming X"
directly to "flipping my Y switch to X", the failure of eir switch to
become Registered resulted in a failure of emself to become Registered.

Therefore, Droowl is not a player.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

Instances of switches are attributes of entities, not
entities in their own right.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

Per my gratuitous arguments, the caller's arguments fail at "Droowl's
citizenship has a citizenship switch".  No other reason has been given
that Droowl's registration would have been ineffective.

=========================  Criminal Case 3152  =========================

    Murphy failed to publish the IADoP's report, the Assessor's report,
    and the Registrar's report during the week Mon. 16 - Sun. 22,
    violating Rule 2143 and committing the Class-2 Crime of Tardiness.

Barred:                                 Murphy

Judge:                                  Pavitra
Judgement:                              GUILTY/APOLOGY

========================================================================

History:

Called by FKA441344:                    23 Jan 2012 22:28:07 GMT
Defendant Murphy informed:              23 Jan 2012 22:28:07 GMT
Assigned to Pavitra:                    05 Feb 2012 21:04:03 GMT
Judged GUILTY/APOLOGY by Pavitra:       09 Feb 2012 04:08:03 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

The January 2012 archives of the agora-official mailing list.

========================================================================

Judge Pavitra's Arguments:

Seems pretty straightforward. GUILTY/APOLOGY{peccable, peccadillo,
noyous, eupheuism}

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

I've been guilty of this type of peccadillo before, and on some of
those occasions GUILTY as well.  We are all peccable, of course,
but it's my own noyous fault for letting the messages pile up a
bit - and for failing to propose a change to the required schedule,
or a replacement for points that would make FINE a meaningful
sentence once again.  Rather than try to cover it up with a
convenient euphemism, I--

What's that, you say?  "Eupheuism" /isn't/ a typo?  Well, what's it
mean, then?  Huh.  You don't say.  Well, pretty much any APOLOGY
worth its salt would be one of those, wouldn't it?  Perhaps this
sentence was more lenient than I first appreciated, after all.

Anyway, this message is itself a few hours past deadline, and it
still isn't long enough, and it's well past time for Agora to have
an economy again.  Thus:

Proposal:  The Commonwealth of Agora

Create a rule titled "Rubles" with this text:

      Rubles are a currency.  Ownership of rubles is restricted to
      persons.  The General Secretary is an office, and the recordkeepor
      of rubles.

      At the start of each week, half of each person's rubles (rounded
      down to the nearest integer) are destroyed, then two rubles are
      created in the possession of each player.

Create a rule titled "Poll Fees" with this text:

      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office
      for which no election is already in progress for a cost of
      1 ruble.

Create a rule titled "Ballot Fees" with this text:

      A player CAN change eir voting limit on a specified Agoran
      decision to twice its original value for a cost of 1 ruble.

Proposal:  Water Rationing
(AI = 3)

If rubles are not a currency, then this proposal has no effect.

Create a rule titled "Pool Fees" with Power 3 and this text:

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, if at least five proposals
      have been created earlier in the week, then creating a proposal
      has a cost of 1 ruble.

Proposal:  Chewbacca Defense
(AI = 2)

If rubles are not a currency, then this proposal has no effect.

Create a rule titled "Legal Fees" with Power 2 and this text:

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, if at least five judicial
      cases have been created earlier in the week, then creating a
      judicial case has a cost of 1 ruble.

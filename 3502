==============================  CFJ 3502  ==============================

      It is possible to create an agency such that its acronym contains
      at least one integer symbol (e.g. 0-9).

========================================================================

Caller:                       Quazie

Judge:                        o
Judgement:                    TRUE

========================================================================

History:

Called by Quazie:             20 May 2017
Assigned to o:                20 May 2017
Judged TRUE by o:             22 May 2017

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Agencies might be a limited resource of (26^3) possible existing agencies.
From my reading of rule 2461, it seems like a number is likely not possible
within an agency's Acronym, as numbers aren't words, but I wouldn't be
surprised if non-english words would allow us to get to more than
(26^3) agencies [More language bits!].

Parts of 2461:
..

            a) A title, which must be exactly three words, not
               counting conjunctions, articles or prepositions.

..

      An Agency, once created, SHOULD be referred to by the acronym
      formed from its title with conjunctions, articles, and
      prepositions removed. The acronym of an agency must be unique
      and any attempt to create or amend an Agency such that two
      Agencies would have the same acronym is INEFFECTIVE.

========================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

Rule 2467 sets out the vital attributes of an Agency. Most relevantly,
its acronym:

> An Agency, once created, SHOULD be referred to by the acronym formed
> from its title with conjunctions, articles, and prepositions removed.

and its title:

> a) A title, which must be exactly three words, not counting
> conjunctions, articles or prepositions.

The term “word” is not restricted by the rules, and therefore has its
common definition. Moreover, Agoran convention permits the use of
numerals as words. See, for example, the identifier of this call for
judgement. Therefore, an Agency may have a numeral in its title, which,
being neither a conjunction, an article, or a preposition, would
necessarily be used to form its acronym.

It isn’t clear how a numeral should be compressed to form part of an
acronym. It is conceivable that the first digit of a numeral should be
used in place of the whole numeral, and this appears to be consistent
with the rules regarding Agency names and acronyms.

Therefore, it is possible for an Agency’s acronym to contain a digit -
an integer symbol, as defined.
